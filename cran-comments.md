## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Added a web reference for the API to the `Description` section of the DESCRIPTION file.

* Removed calls to `set_govinfo_key()` from all examples throughout the package, so as not to write to the user's home filespace.

## Resubmission

This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Addressed the potentially misspelled words in the DESCRIPTION file.

* Addressed the URLs that failed the URL check.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
